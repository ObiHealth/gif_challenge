You are a developer tasked with creating a web application that adds features to our gif displaying frontend.

Currently, the application displays paginated trending gifs.

You have been tasked with adding some functionality to the application:
1. Add a search bar that allows gifs to be searched for while retaining ability to see trending gifs
2. In search mode, gifs should be loaded infinitely instead of being displayed with explicit pagination
3. Users should be able to favorite gifs and see their favorited gifs in a separate section
4. Implement autocomplete with search suggestions API
